# Basic-Programming

This is a gentle introduction (with code samples in C++ and JavaScript) to programming, on Data Structures, Searchin & Sorting Algorithms. Algorithms with pseudocode is also added.

## Getting Started

The content is intended to those who are new to programming and to those who'd like to refer the basics. I've created C/C++ and JavaScript code samples for respective algorithms and techniques.

### Contents
* [Data Structures](#Data-Structures.ipynb)
* [Search Algorithms](#Searching.ipynb)
* [Sorting Algorithms](#Sorting.ipynb)
* [C++ Scripts](#C++-Scripts)
* [JavaScript Scripts](#JavaSscript-Scripts)

## Prerequisites

Basic programming knowledge (C/C++/JavaScript). A newbie to programming can also get benefitted from these.

## Installing

To run the scripts, One should be able to 
* install C/C++ IDEs
* install Javascript 

## Running the tests

No tests attached so far..

### Break down into end to end tests

No tests attached so far..

### And coding style tests

No tests attached so far..

## Deployment

Few of the codes are non-deployable, these are for refernce/knowledge only

## Built With

* __[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)__
* C/C++
* Javascript
