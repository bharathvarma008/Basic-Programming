# Basic-Programming

This is a gentle introduction (with code samples in C++ and JavaScript) to programming, on Data Structures, Searchin & Sorting Algorithms. Algorithms with pseudocode is also added.

## Getting Started

The content is intended to those who are new to programming and to those who'd like to refer the basics. I've created C/C++ and JavaScript code samples for respective algorithms and techniques.

* __[Data Structures](https://github.com/bharathvarma008/Basic-Programming/blob/master/Data%20Structures.ipynb)__
* __[Search Algorithms](https://github.com/bharathvarma008/Basic-Programming/blob/master/Searching.ipynb)__
* __[Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/bharathvarma008/Basic-Programming/blob/master/Sorting.ipynb)__
* __[C++ Scripts](https://github.com/bharathvarma008/Basic-Programming/tree/master/C%2B%2B%20Scripts)__
* __[JavaScript Scripts](https://github.com/bharathvarma008/Basic-Programming/tree/master/JavaSscript%20Scripts)__

## Prerequisites

Basic programming knowledge (C/C++/JavaScript). A newbie to programming can also get benefitted from these.

## Installing

To run the scripts, One should be able to 
* install C/C++ IDEs
* install Javascript 

## Running the tests

No tests attached so far..

### Break down into end to end tests

No tests attached so far..

### And coding style tests

No tests attached so far..

## Deployment

Few of the codes are non-deployable, these are for refernce/knowledge only

## Built With

* __[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)__
* C/C++
* Javascript
