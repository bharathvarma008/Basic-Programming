    "A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primitive Data Types:\n",
    "The actual range of primitive data types that is available is dependent upon the specific programming language that is being used. For example, in C#, strings are a composite but built-in data type, whereas in modern dialects of BASIC and in JavaScript, they are assimilated to a primitive data type that is both basic and built-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic basic primitive types may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Character** (character, char);\n",
    "* **Integer** (integer, int, short, long, byte) with a variety of precisions;\n",
    "* **Floating-point number** (float, double, real, double precision);\n",
    "* **Fixed-point number (fixed)** with a variety of precisions and a programmer-selected scale.\n",
    "* **Boolean**, logical values true and false.\n",
    "* Reference (also called a *pointer* or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required (Depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.\n",
